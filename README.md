# Zip-File-Extractor

In my current role as an Engineer, we frequently work with documents shared by other teams/departments or downloaded from document control platforms, many of which are delivered in zip files. These zip files often contain important documents needed for the next stages of fabrication, and my team relies on them for various tasks. 

However, I noticed a common inefficiency: my coworkers were manually unzipping each folder one by one, which took up a lot of time. To address this, I developed a Python script that automates the process of unzipping multiple zip files in a folder. The script extracts only the relevant files, such as .pcf and .pdf, and copies them into a designated folder. This solution not only saves time but also helps maintain an organized workspace by separating the necessary documents from the rest.

By automating the extraction and file management process, this solution improves efficiency, reduces manual work, and ensures that all relevant files are easily accessible for the team.
